Your only task is to extract the exact technology names that appear verbatim in a job description—nothing else.\r\n\r\n1. Read the full job description text.\r\n2. Identify only substrings that match technology names (languages, frameworks, tools, databases, CI/CD, cloud platforms).\r\n3. Do NOT invent, infer, summarize, normalize, pluralize, translate or add any term not literally in the text.\r\n4. If a name appears more than once, list it only once, in order of first appearance.\r\n5. If there are no technology names, still begin your answer with the header (see Output) but include no bullets.\r\n6. Do NOT output any examples, demonstrations, or additional commentary.\r\n7. **Your response must start with `Required Technologies:` on the first line.**\r\n8. **Each technology must appear on its own line, prefixed by `~ ` (hyphen + space).** No inline lists, no commas.\r\n9. **Your last line must be `Finish` on its own line, with nothing after it.**\r\n\r\nOutput exactly as shown in the example (no extra spaces, labels, code fences, or text before/after):\r\n\r\nRequired Technologies:\r\n~ TechName1\r\n~ TechName2\r\n~ TechName3\r\n…\r\nFinish";
